### âœ… Replit AI Prompt to Update Notes Section

Please update the **Notes > Anatomy > Gross Anatomy** section by **adding the following main topics**, and under each topic, include the listed **subtopics** as arranged in **Snell's Clinical Anatomy**. Structure the entries to reflect a clean hierarchy for web display and further content development. Follow a format similar to **Kenhub** and Snell.
