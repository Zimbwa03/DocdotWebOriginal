I want you to help create a propmt for these feature on my replit angent.

so l have a Quiz page, I want a buttons to be added under MCQS. that button will be Cutomize Exam!

So above if the type of the exam that we will write in this format

1. Concerning the bones of the upper Limb
a} Clavicle is a vertical long bone
b) Radius tapers distally
c) Humerus is the longest bone in the body
d) Ulna bone has attachment site for bicep brachii
e) Capitate is the first bone to ossify. 

example is the above question paper so you will answer like there puting true or false:

1. Concerning the bones of the upper Limb
F a} Clavicle is a vertical long bone
F b) Radius tapers distally
F c) Humerus is the longest bone in the body
F d) Ulna bone has attachment site for bicep brachii
T e) Capitate is the first bone to ossify. 

write so this want we want to create. 

1. Customize quiz will have two buttons Anatomy Standard Exam and Physiology Standard Exam
In Anatomy
Student select topics either from the following topics:
Upper Limb
Thorax
Head and Neck
Lower Limb
Adbomen
Neurophysiology 
 the student can choose either 1 or 2 or all depending on the exam the student want to make.

After selecting the student has to put the Number of stems from these list 10, 20, 40, 75(proffessional)

Then Click a button: Start Exam

So, we are going to generate standard stems for the topics selected and will be randomized using Deep Seek Ai. 

lets say the student pick Upper limb, so a 1 stem will look like this:

1. Concerning the bones of the upper Limb
a} Clavicle is a vertical long bone
b) Radius tapers distally
c) Humerus is the longest bone in the body
d) Ulna bone has attachment site for bicep brachii
e) Capitate is the first bone to ossify. 

So they will be created, in random from any region in Upper Limb Anatomy, 
That will happen to any of the topics that the student would have created. e.g Thorax + Upper Limb+ head and Neck etc. 

The questions should be generated using these reference text books.
Snell Clinical Anatomy Book
Gray's Anatomy Book
Keith moore Anatomy Book
Teachmeanatomy.com notes
Kenhub.com

The stems should be standard and of high quality as the document provided above "Head and neck inclass"

so Ai will generate the number of Stems selected buy the student, in this well

1. Concerning the bones of the upper Limb (upperlimb- it writes the topic in italic at the end of the stem)
a} Clavicle is a vertical long bone
Answer "False"  
Expalnation "Clavice is a horizontal bone"
b) Radius tapers distally
Answer "False"
Expalanation "Radius widens distally"
c) Humerus is the longest bone in the body
Answer "False" 
Explanation "Femur is the longest bone in the body"
d) Ulna bone has attachment site for bicep brachii
Answer "False"
Explanation "Ulna has an attachment for brachialis"
e) Capitate is the first bone to ossify. 
Answer "True"
Explanation "Capitate is the first bone to ossify" 

So, this will be one stem that will generated by Deep Seek Ai, the exaplanations should very sound and detailed coming from the References above. 

It will only show this to the student:

1. Concerning the bones of the upper Limb
a} Clavicle is a vertical long bone
b) Radius tapers distally
c) Humerus is the longest bone in the body
d) Ulna bone has attachment site for bicep brachii
e) Capitate is the first bone to ossify. 

While it would have stored this in the Supabase Database, 

1. Concerning the bones of the upper Limb (upperlimb- it writes the topic in italic at the end of the stem)
a} Clavicle is a vertical long bone
Answer "False"  
Expalnation "Clavice is a horizontal bone"
b) Radius tapers distally
Answer "False"
Expalanation "Radius widens distally"
c) Humerus is the longest bone in the body
Answer "False" 
Explanation "Femur is the longest bone in the body"
d) Ulna bone has attachment site for bicep brachii
Answer "False"
Explanation "Ulna has an attachment for brachialis"
e) Capitate is the first bone to ossify. 
Answer "True"
Explanation "Capitate is the first bone to ossify" 


Here will be the interface, It has to look like a proffessional Exam Paper. it will be having e.g we have generated this question:

1. Concerning the bones of the upper Limb
Button of T and of F a} Clavicle is a vertical long bone
Button of T and of F b) Radius tapers distally
Button of T and of F c) Humerus is the longest bone in the body
Button of T and of F d) Ulna bone has attachment site for bicep brachii
Button of T and of F e) Capitate is the first bone to ossify. 

so the student will be clicking T for True and F for False, after the student has answered: it mark for the Student, using answers that would have been stored in the supabase database for every stem generated. 

the student will Click Submit Exam button. 

here is how you calculate the Mark: Using negative marking for stem option. That for every correct answer is +1 for every wrong answer is - 1 the it add all one and substract with minus one's and express the mark as a precentage of the Total, 

Take note, The student can skip what he do not know and if it not answered the mark of that option will be 0. 

e.g 
1. Concerning the bones of the upper Limb
F a} Clavicle is a vertical long bone (+1)
T b) Radius tapers distally(- 1)
c) Humerus is the longest bone in the body(0)
Td) Ulna bone has attachment site for bicep brachii (-1)
T e) Capitate is the first bone to ossify. (+1)

for the stem the student has (2-2) = 0, so the student has 0/5 * 100 = 0%

so the mark will be displayed the total spent. 
Then there will be a Review Exam, when these butto is clicked. 

It will highlight every option of the student got wrong, it will say 

1. Concerning the bones of the upper Limb
 b) Radius tapers distally 
Answer "False"
Expalanation "Radius widens distally"

then it does for every question that the student got wrong. 

Timer of the Exam is 2 minutes per Stem, so

if the student choice to generate 10 stems the timer will be 20 minutes. 
after 20 minutes is done. The exam should end even though the student has not finished the exam and calculate the mark of what the student has written..



now Create an accurate and clear prompt for replit to add these feature under Quiz in the MCQS.
