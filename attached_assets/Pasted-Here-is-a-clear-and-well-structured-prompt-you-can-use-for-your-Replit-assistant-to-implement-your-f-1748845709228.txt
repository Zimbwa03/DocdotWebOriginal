Here is a clear and well-structured prompt you can use for your Replit assistant to implement your feature accurately:

**Prompt for Replit Assistant:**

I am building a study assistant interface. Please update the UI and functionality according to the following requirements:

### 1. **Rearrange the Main Layout**

* On the first row, place the following in this order:

  1. **Study Timer**
  2. **Study Planner**
  3. **Study Groups**
  4. **Study Tips**
* **Remove** the section labeled "Study Sections".

---

### 2. **Study Planner Functionality**

* Allow users to **add a study session**.
* Let users **update/edit** the scheduled time for that session.
* When the scheduled session icon is **clicked**, it should change to **"Completed"**, and visually indicate this (e.g., change color or animation to show it's done).
* Make this interaction **dynamic and lively** (use visual feedback like checkmarks or transitions).

### 3. **Study Groups Functionality**

#### a. **Creating a Group**

* When a user **creates a study group**, they must provide either a:

  * **Zoom link** or
  * **Google Meet link**.

#### b. **Join Now Button Logic**

* If the meeting is **currently active**, the **"Join Now"** button becomes active.

  * Display the appropriate **Zoom or Google Meet icon** next to the button based on the link type.
  * When another user **clicks to join**, increment the visible **member count** for that group.

* If the meeting is **scheduled for the future** (e.g., tomorrow at 11:30 AM):

  * The **"Join Now"** button should show **"Pending"**.
  * If a user **clicks "Pending"**, automatically:

    * Set a **reminder** for that user.
    * 30 minutes before the scheduled time, **send an email reminder** using the email from the userâ€™s **Supabase authentication**.
    * The email must include:

      * The meeting link (Zoom or Google Meet),
      * The time of the meeting.

Let me know if you'd like the Supabase email function and scheduling logic written in JavaScript or Python.
