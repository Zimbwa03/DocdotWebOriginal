Here is a complete **prompt for Replit** (or any AI agent like DeepSeek running in Replit) that describes the **Customize Exam** feature under the **Quiz Page â†’ MCQs** section. You can paste or adjust this as needed for your Replit agent or developer interface:

### âœ… Prompt for Replit AI Agent â€“ Customize Exam Feature for DocDot Quiz Page

**Task:**
Add a new feature under the MCQs section on the Quiz Page called **"Customize Exam!"**

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Main Features:

When "Customize Exam!" is clicked, show:

1. **Two buttons**:

   * ðŸ§  Anatomy Standard Exam
   * ðŸ©º Physiology Standard Exam

2. If "Anatomy Standard Exam" is selected:

   * Show **checkboxes or multi-select** options for topics:

     * Upper Limb
     * Thorax
     * Head and Neck
     * Lower Limb
     * Abdomen
     * Neurophysiology

3. User then selects the **number of stems** for the exam:

   * 10, 20, 40, 75 (Professional)

4. Then they click: **Start Exam**

### ðŸ§  Stem Generation Logic:

* Use **DeepSeek AI** to generate each stem from selected topics.
* Each stem is structured like this:

```text
1. Concerning the bones of the upper Limb
a) Clavicle is a vertical long bone
b) Radius tapers distally
c) Humerus is the longest bone in the body
d) Ulna bone has attachment site for bicep brachii
e) Capitate is the first bone to ossify.
```

* Each stem should be randomly generated from the **chosen topics**.

* Use these **reference sources** for accurate, high-standard question generation:

  * Snell Clinical Anatomy
  * Grayâ€™s Anatomy
  * Keith Moore
  * TeachMeAnatomy.com
  * Kenhub.com

* Behind the scenes, store the full answer and explanation in Supabase like this:

```json
{
  "stem": "Concerning the bones of the upper Limb",
  "topic": "upperlimb",
  "items": [
    {
      "option": "a",
      "statement": "Clavicle is a vertical long bone",
      "answer": "False",
      "explanation": "Clavicle is a horizontal bone"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

* But **only show the questions** to students without answers.

---

### ðŸ§ª Exam Interface:

* Display each stem like a **professional exam paper**.
* For each option (aâ€“e), add **T (True)** and **F (False)** toggle buttons.
* Timer: **2 minutes per stem**.

  * If 10 stems selected, total exam time = 20 minutes.
  * After time elapses, auto-submit and grade based on answered questions only.

---

### âœ… Marking Logic:

* +1 for every correct response
* â€“1 for every incorrect response
* 0 for skipped (no selection)
* Final score = `(Correct â€“ Incorrect) / Total options answered Ã— 100%`

ðŸ§® **Example Calculation:**

```text
1. Concerning the bones of the upper Limb
F a) Clavicle is a vertical long bone (+1)
T b) Radius tapers distally (â€“1)
-- c) Humerus is the longest bone in the body (0)
T d) Ulna bone has attachment site for bicep brachii (â€“1)
T e) Capitate is the first bone to ossify (+1)

Score: (2 â€“ 2) = 0, Total options attempted = 4
Percentage: 0 / 5 * 100 = 0%
```

---

### ðŸ“„ After Exam Submission:

1. Display studentâ€™s final score and time spent.
2. Add a **"Review Exam"** button:

   * For each wrong answer, show:

     ```text
     Question:
     b) Radius tapers distally
     Answer: False
     Explanation: Radius widens distally
     ```

---

### ðŸ”§ Backend:

* Store all generated stems with answers and explanations in Supabase.
* Use topic tags like `"upperlimb"`, `"thorax"`, `"abdomen"`, etc.
* Ensure stem quality matches professional standards such as provided in "Head and Neck Inclass" file.
